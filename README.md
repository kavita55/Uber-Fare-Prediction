# Uber Fare Prediction

## Description

The project focuses on Uber Inc., the world's largest taxi company. In this project, we aim to predict the fare for future Uber transactions. With Uber serving hundreds of thousands of customers daily, managing their data effectively is crucial for devising new business strategies and ensuring optimal results. Accurately estimating fare prices is essential for the company's operations.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following fields:

- **key**: a unique identifier for each trip
- **fare_amount**: the cost of each trip in USD
- **pickup_datetime**: date and time when the meter was engaged
- **passenger_count**: the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver-entered value)
- **pickup_longitude**: the longitude where the meter was engaged
- **pickup_latitude**: the latitude where the meter was engaged
- **dropoff_longitude**: the longitude where the meter was disengaged
- **dropoff_latitude**: the latitude where the meter was disengaged

### Acknowledgement

The dataset is referenced from Kaggle.

## Objective

1. **Understand the Dataset & Cleanup (if required)**: We will explore the dataset, check for missing values, outliers, and perform any necessary data cleaning.
2. **Build Regression Models to Predict Fare Price**: Utilize machine learning regression techniques to predict the fare price of Uber rides.
3. **Evaluate Models & Compare Their Respective Scores**: Assess the performance of different regression models using metrics like R-squared (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.

## Steps Taken

The solution is divided into the following sections:

1. **Reading and Understanding Data**: Loading the dataset and gaining insights into its structure and contents.
2. **Inspecting the DataFrame**: Checking for missing values, outliers, and understanding the distribution of variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering & Data Visualization**: Analyzing relationships between variables, creating new features if necessary, and visualizing data to gain insights.
4. **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Building regression models using various algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
5. **Residual Analysis**: Assessing the model's performance by analyzing residuals and other diagnostic plots.

## Instructions

To run the code:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided.
